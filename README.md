Sometimes putting five things in a straight line is the perfect solution, but other times, letting them dance to the beat of their own drum can create a beautiful chaos that defies all expectation. ‚Äî ChatGPT

Order and Chaos is a 2-player game played on a 6-by-6 (or bigger) grid of squares. One player is Order, the other is Chaos. They take turns placing either an X or an O in an empty square (players always have the choice of placing an X or O). Order wins if they make 5 Xs or Os in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and Chaos wins if they can prevent this.

An unusual feature of this game is that both players can play Xs and Os. On their turn, a player can choose to play either an X or an O.

For this assignment, your task is to implement Order and Chaos allowing a human player to play against the computer.

Working with a Partner

If you like, you can work with a partner on this assignment. To set this up, you and your partner should join an assignment 5 group on Canvas.

If you do with a partner, keep this in mind:

Both partners will get the same mark.

Only one partner needs to submit the assignment on Canvas, as part of the team.

It‚Äôs fine if you want to work on your own.

Requirements

1 mark: Display instructions for the human at the start of the game.

1 mark: The game is played on a 6-by-6 grid of squares.

1 mark: In addition to a 6√ó6 grid size, the user can also choose grids of size 7√ó7, 8√ó8, or 9√ó9.

1 mark: The human moves first or second at random.

1 mark: The human types there moves in some easy way (e.g. by entering the coordinates of the square they want to place their piece in). 1 mark: Moves entered by the user are checked for validity. If a move is invalid, then ask the user to re-enter their move. A move is valid if it refers to an empty square on the board, and there is not already an X or O there.

The human resigns. In this case, the human loses and the computer wins.

Order makes 5 Xs or Os in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). In this case Order wins, and Chaos loses.

There are no empty squares left on the board, and there is no line of 5 Xs or Os. In this case, Chaos wins and Order loses.

1 mark: When the game is over, display a message indicating who won.

1 mark: After a game ends, the user is asked if they want to play again. If they say yes, then start a new game. If they say no, then exit the program.

1 mark: A class is used to represent the playing board. A good name for this class is Board.

1 mark: At least one other class/struct is used in a sensible way. For example, you could use a struct to represent a player, storing whether they are Order or Chaos, and whether they are human or computer.

All code is sensibly and consistently indented, and all lines are 100 characters in length, or less.

Whitespace is used to group related pieces of a code to make it easier for humans to read. All whitespace has a purpose.

Variable and function names are self-descriptive.

Appropriate features of C++ are used, as discussed in class and in the notes. Note If you use a feature that we haven‚Äôt discussed in class, you must explain it in a comment, even if you think it‚Äôs obvious.

Comments are used when needed to explain chunks of code whose purpose is not obvious from the code itself. There should be no commented-out code from previous versions.

an explanation, in high-level terms, of the strategy the computer player follows acknowledgements of any help you received the report is neatly formatted, uses full sentences, good grammar, and correct spelling

Deductions

Constraints

You can #include any standard C++ libraries, i.e. any libraries that come with every C++17 compiler. Code and files from the web are not allowed: all the code in your program should be written by you.

As always, you must cite all help you get. If a website, book, person, etc. helps you with this assignment, then cite their help in the report at the end.

Submitting Your Work

On Canvas, please submit just the file a5.cpp with your answers in it. Don‚Äôt submit anything else.

The marker will compile your a5.cpp using the standard course makefile.

No other files will be in the folder your program is compiled in. In particular, cmpt_error.h and cmpt_trace.h will not be in the folder when your a5.cpp is compiled.

Remember, if you are working with a partner, then only one of you needs to submit the assignment on Canvas.

Basic Requirements

It must compile on Ubuntu Linux using the standard course makefile:

$ make a5 g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -Wno-sign-compare -Wnon-virtual-dtor -g a5.cpp o a5

If your program fails to compile, your mark for this assignment will be 0.

A copy of cmpt_error.h will be in the same folder as a5.cpp when it‚Äôs compiled, so your program can use cmpt::error if necessary.

It must have no memory leaks or memory errors, according to valgrind, e.g.:

‚Äú` $ valgrind ./a5

// ‚Ä¶ lots of output ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú`

A program is considered to have no memory error if:

In the LEAK SUMMARY, definitely lost, indirectly lost, and possibly lost must all be 0.

The ERROR SUMMARY reports 0 errors.

It is usually okay if still reachable reports a non- zero number of bytes.

You must include the large comment section with student info and the statement of originality. If your submitted file does not have this, then we will assume your work is not original and it will not be marked.

If your program meets all these basic requirements, then it will graded using the marking scheme on Canvas.

Hints

You can, but are not required, to use inheritance, recursion, pointers, etc. Only use a feature if it makes sense to use it.

A good way to start this program is to create a Board class that represents the board, and has a method to print it out. Also add a method like make_user_move() that, when called, asks the user to enter a move and then plays it on the board (re-asking if they enter an invalid move).

Your board could be drawn like this:

1 2 3 4 5 6 a . . . . . . b . . . . . . c . . X . . . d . . . X . . e . . . . X . f . . . . . O

For instance, the O in the bottom-right corner is at position ‚Äúf6‚Äù.

For entering moves, you could, as shown above, label each row of the board with a letter, and each column with a number. If the user enters ‚Äúa3x‚Äù on the board above, the board will look like this:

1 2 3 4 5 6 a . . X . . . b . . . . . . c . . X . . . d . . . X . . e . . . . X . f . . . . . O

If you run into bugs, a simple debugging technique is to add print statements that print out the values of variables, e.g. cout &lt;&lt; ‚Äúdebug: x=‚Äù &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; ‚Äò ‚Äò;. Putting ‚Äúdebug:‚Äù at the start makes it easier to find all these lines and comment them out (e.g. before submitting your finished program).
